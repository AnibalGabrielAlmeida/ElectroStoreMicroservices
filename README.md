# ElectroStoreMicroservices

## Description
ElectroStoreMicroservices is an ongoing project aimed at establishing the backend infrastructure for a modern and efficient appliance store. Employing a microservices architecture, this project seeks to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing products, orders, inventory, and other essential operations within the context of an appliance-focused retail environment.

## Key Features and Technologies
- **Microservices Architecture:** Embracing a microservices approach, each component functions independently, fostering scalability and modular maintenance. I'm using Spring Boot for this approach.
- **Pattern Implementations:**
  - **API Gateway:** Centralized management and routing of API requests for enhanced performance and security. Applied Spring Cloud Gateway.
  - **Circuit Breaker:** Ensuring system stability by preventing the propagation of faults through automatic failover. Implemented with Resilience4j.
  - **Service Registry & Discovery:** Facilitating dynamic service registration and discovery for efficient communication between microservices. Technology: Eureka Server.
  - **Load Balancing:** Load balancing optimizes the distribution of incoming network traffic across multiple servers, preventing overload and ensuring optimal resource utilization. Utilizing Spring Cloud LoadBalancer.
  - **Config Server:** A Config Server centralizes the management of configuration settings for individual microservices. Still in development.
  - **Docker**: Still in development. Utilized for containerization and deployment of microservices, enhancing portability and scalability.

## Future Development
As the project evolves, one of the key focus areas is the integration of containerization using Docker for deployment. Docker containers will enable seamless packaging and deployment of individual microservices, enhancing portability, scalability, and ease of management in diverse environments.
Additionally, there are plans to implement a frontend for the application to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the appliance store. The choice between Astro and React frameworks is currently under consideration.

- **Astro:** Considered for its ability to build modern websites using the same structure as React but with a focus on performance and developer experience. Astro offers features like automatic server-side rendering and partial hydration, which could enhance the overall performance and user experience of the application.

- **React:** Another strong contender known for its flexibility and extensive ecosystem of libraries and tools. React provides a component-based architecture, making it easier to manage complex user interfaces. Additionally, React's popularity and large community support ensure access to a wealth of resources and expertise.

The decision between Astro and React will depend on factors such as project requirements, team expertise, and desired performance characteristics. Further evaluation and experimentation will help determine the most suitable framework for the frontend implementation.
