# ElectroStoreMicroservices

## Description
ElectroStoreMicroservices is an ongoing project aimed at establishing the backend infrastructure for a modern and efficient appliance store. Employing a microservices architecture, this project seeks to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing products, orders, inventory, and other essential operations within the context of an appliance-focused retail environment.

## Key Features
- **Microservices Architecture:** Embracing a microservices approach, each component functions independently, fostering scalability and modular maintenance.
- **Pattern Implementations:**
  - **API Gateway:** Centralized management and routing of API requests for enhanced performance and security.
  - **Circuit Breaker:** Ensuring system stability by preventing the propagation of faults through automatic failover.
  - **Service Registry & Discovery:** Facilitating dynamic service registration and discovery for efficient communication between microservices.
  - **Load Balancing:** Load balancing optimizes the distribution of incoming network traffic across multiple servers, preventing overload and ensuring optimal resource utilization. 
  - **Config Server:** A Config Server centralizes the management of configuration settings for individual microservices. 

## Future Development
As the project evolves, one of the key focus areas is the integration of containerization using Docker for deployment. Docker containers will enable seamless packaging and deployment of individual microservices, enhancing portability, scalability, and ease of management in diverse environments.
Also I'm considering a frontend implementation.
