# ElectroStoreMicroservices

## Description
ElectroStoreMicroservices is an ongoing project aimed at establishing the backend infrastructure for a modern and efficient appliance store. Employing a microservices architecture, this project seeks to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing products, orders, inventory, and other essential operations within the context of an appliance-focused retail environment.

## Key Features
- **Microservices Architecture:** Embracing a microservices approach, each component functions independently, fostering scalability and modular maintenance.
- **Pattern Implementations:**
  - **API Gateway:** Centralized management and routing of API requests for enhanced performance and security.
  - **Circuit Breaker:** Ensuring system stability by preventing the propagation of faults through automatic failover.
  - **Service Discovery:** Facilitating dynamic service registration and discovery for efficient communication between microservices.

## Future Development
As the project evolves, I'm planing to incorporate additional design patterns to enhance the scalability, reliability, and overall efficiency of ElectroStoreMicroservices.
